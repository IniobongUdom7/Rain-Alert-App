# Rain-Alert-App
This app is useful during raining season as it sends alert to your phone before you leave the house that you should carry umbrella with you.
I used openweathermap api to fetch current weather in my city calabar
It is hosted on pythoneverywhere.com 
I also use twilio.com to generate a phone number used in sending the notification
